      disposal : Open UPM Registry and Local Package configuration.


      The easiest
      way to install it is through the OpenUPM package registry, which will result
      in the same functionaility and workflow as a regular package.


      If you
      want to use the package and do some modifications to it, you can clone the
      project at github and reference it as a local package using the Package Manager
      window.'
